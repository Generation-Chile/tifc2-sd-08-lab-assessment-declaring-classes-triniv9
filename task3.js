/*3. You have now been asked to include a method that will output a string to the console announcing a level up.
    * Modify the Player class so that it will accept a player name string and a level number in two separate arguments.
    * Then, define a shared object method `info()` that will print the following string, replacing the two placeholders:
        * `<name> has reached Level <level>!`
            * A player named **Tara** at level **6** should result in "`Tara has reached Level 6!`" printed to the console.*/


export class Player {
  constructor(name, level) {
    this.name = name;
    this.level = level;
  }
 info() {
  console.log(`${this.name} has reached Level ${this.level}!`)

  }
}
